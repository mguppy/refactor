# refactor
Description: This project is considered a refactor - I modified existing code to meet the set of standards set in the task.  For the accessibility ask, I added alt tags and added sections like header, main and footer.    I updated the code so that all links now work correctly.  I consolidated a lot of the CSS code so that is easier to follow as well as added comments.
